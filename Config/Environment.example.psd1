# Environment configuration for the Enterprise Patch Toolkit
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file declares environment-specific values (domains, file shares,
# trusted runner hosts, org tags) so that the scripts themselves stay
# generic.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to Config\Environment.psd1 (same directory).
#   2. Fill in values for your environment.
#   3. Leave Environment.psd1 out of source control (it is gitignored).
#
# Scripts load this via Import-RSLEnvironment in the Modules\RSL-Environment
# module. If Environment.psd1 is missing, the loader falls back to this
# example file so the repo is still runnable for a smoke test.

    # as a workgroup machine and skip domain prefix/suffix stripping.
